# Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Version 1

**Intro**

Around the U.S. is a social media app demo featuring a profile with an avatar, name, and description, and a gallery of images. The app will be developed over the course of multiple projects, each expanding on the features and functionality. Below is an overview of the elements featured in each version.

**Version 1**

Version 1 showcases html and css knowledge. Very little interactivity has been added to the site yet, as it serves mostly as a design mockup at this stage. This version of the project showcases BEM file and class organization, responsive design techniques such as media queries, flexbox, and grid, as well as limited interactivity in the form of hoverable buttons (with no current function other than an aesthetic change while hovering).

This version also served as a litmus test for programming a project essentially from scratch, using a figma design. And while it wasn't entirely created from scratch, using screencasts for help with certain sections, for the most part the project was still developed independently.

The project also showcases a small degree of web design, at intermediary breakpoints between the provided mobile and desktop designs. Since these intermediary stages were not explicitly given in the figma design, there was a small degree of freedom to design how best to navigate these resolutions while maintaining aesthetics and functionality, and providing as seamless a transition as was reasonable.
